@ominamai @ollows_rugby hehe and till rules are put in place, it's a carte blanche.
@Akhaenda I agree @Ollows_Rugby Her team used her to win-nobody in their right mind would play proper defence on her.there should b rules!!
@ominamai @ollows_rugby then again a woman wud know her body better. some can be up n about till month 9 others r tired by month 3
@Ollows_Rugby unfortunately no documented rules,guess they never anticipated a 8mnth pgd woman to play!I played till I was 2mnths due in '09
RT @Ollows_Rugby: @ominamai There must be a rule somewhere that stops Brunson playing... If not for her then for the unborn... @StandardKen…
@KenyaRugby247 I hope @OfficialKRU has reviewed history of #PampasXV to realize it involves a permanent team based in SA.@Ollows_Rugby
@Ollows_Rugby you need a change of direction. Breaking through sporadically Is not progress.is treu definitely on board now?
RT @Topref1: "@Ollows_Rugby: @Topref1 Hehe! I see you want confirmation... :-) @paultreu" that's a wise thing to do
Couple months ago we joked about u being coach for @kenya_7s with @Ollows_Rugby ,u said u admire our team,finally @paultreu is here #karibu
@Ollows_Rugby @FelixTotty from what I've read he has been involved with the team for over 15yrs in various capacities! Surely u see my point
"@Ollows_Rugby: @Topref1 Hehe! I see you want confirmation... :-) @paultreu" that's a wise thing to do
@Ollows_Rugby okay i will work on that this coming weekend thanks man

This program on DStv channel 174 'Date from Hell' flashback to what happened at #westgate hunting innocent prey. @malebopo @benayimba
@benayimba hehehe. Avail yourself kesho. I'll call you.
@benayimba I see you're name was to be removed from a certain list. Hilarious!
@benayimba very true. But players are not highly regarded here. @UR7s
@benayimba Guess that settles the Mombasa SC debate on whether you're a VIP or not hehehehe! Rugby imekuwa na busybodies kabisa!@TONYANGO
@benayimba Which Secretariat? The Awards Secretariat? @TONYANGO

@Ollows_Rugby @TONYANGO @benayimba Thanks Ollowiz, I've been wondering on the intended replacement
So then @TONYANGO, since there're no secrets in KE, who was to be @benayimba's replacement?
@benayimba Ok, understood. I thought someone was making a petition to take that one away. One cant be too sure these days :-) @TONYANGO

RT @TONYANGO: @officialkru jack wanted to replace @benayimba with one of his pals, a 'gorvenor' perhaps? Beneficiaries tunajua.

"@TONYANGO How does Jack @officialkru with zero rugby pedigree have the balls to try walk on the same ground as @benayimba?"
"@TONYANGO Jack @officialkru zero positive for rugby, for him to open his mouth where @benayimba is concerned is a travesty."
Infact a Day! RT @TONYANGO @benayimba has done more for this game in a month than Jack @officialkru will ever do in his lifetime!!!
