@gathara @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi This is absurdly bad reasoning. You need sthng like # of attacks prevented/# attacks attempted
Hey neighbour, #NyumbaKumi does not include sharing my WiFi. Thank you.
terrorists no to terrorize. Thus the talk on what the people we pay to do so performed. @danielwaweru @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi
@gathara @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi I can show you multiple things in my inbox.
I think most are looking at how to prevent attacks since we apparently can't depend on @danielwaweru @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi
I don't think anyone has said the terrorists aren't at faut. It seems rather superfluous. @danielwaweru @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi
@gathara @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi have been nobbled. IIRC, one of the witnesses who withdrew suddenly bought a new car.

@gathara @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi the fault of your attackers, but yours. See if you can apply the lesson in a nearby case.
@gathara @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi It's your job to stop baddies attacking you. It doesn't follow that when you fail, it's not
@gathara @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi Is it your job to prevent yourself being attacked? Are your responsible if you *are* attacked?
Thought that's what Nyumba Kumi is supposedly about. @danielwaweru @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi
Not GoK's job to try stop the baddies? @danielwaweru @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi
Or when GoK fails to act on the intelligence it gets or KDF fucks up in #Westgate, no? @AEMuhindi @danielwaweru @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi
@gathara @AEMuhindi @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi People have managed to transfer responsibility for attack from terrorists to government. Get in
I suppose I am to blame when terrorists bribe GoK officials and police. @AEMuhindi @danielwaweru @MombasaNews @NyumbaKumi
